## Preface for Running the Application

When using PlanV, follow these recommendations to achieve the best results:

### Using Flights and Hotels Features

#### Flights:
- Begin by typing in a city to fetch the associated airport results.
- Once the airports are displayed, erase the city name and enter the airport code in all caps (e.g., JFK, LAX) to gather accurate flight results.

#### Hotels:
- Search by city name and select the desired city from the list.
- After selecting the city, wait for the **Search Results** button to appear.
- Click on this button to view hotel options for your destination.

### Important Notes
- The use of pre-set `useState` values for Flights and Hotels is recommended, as these configurations have been tested and confirmed to work.
- Please allow time for hotel search results to load, as a large amount of data is being processed in the background. Rest assured, the functionality works correctly despite potential delays.
