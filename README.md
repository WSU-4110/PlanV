PlanV Application Overview
PlanV is a travel planning application that allows users to organize their trips all in one place. Key features include:

* Generating hotel recommendations.
* Storing flight documents securely.
* Editing user profiles for a personalized experience.

Preface for Running the Application
When using PlanV, follow these recommendations to achieve the best results:
Using Flights and Hotels Features
* Flights:
    * Begin by typing in a city to fetch the associated airport results.
    * Once the airports are displayed, erase the city name and enter the airport code in all caps (e.g., JFK, LAX) to gather accurate flight results.
* Hotels:
    * Search by city name and select the desired city from the list.
    * After selecting the city, wait for the Search Results button to appear.
    * Click on this button to view hotel options for your destination.
Important Notes
* The use of pre-set useState values for Flights and Hotels is recommended, as these configurations have been tested and confirmed to work.
* Please allow time for hotel search results to load, as a large amount of data is being processed in the background. Rest assured, the functionality works correctly despite potential delays.
